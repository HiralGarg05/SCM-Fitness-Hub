            <h3>CRUNCHES</h3>
            <p><b>Crunches</b> are a popular core exercise primarily aimed at strengthening the abdominal muscles. They are an excellent exercise for toning the abs and improving overall core stability. Crunches specifically target the rectus abdominis (the "six-pack" muscles) and the obliques, helping to improve posture and provide support for the spine.<br>
                <b>How to Perform a Basic Crunch</b><br>
                <br>Starting Position: Lie flat on your back on a mat with your knees bent and feet flat on the floor. Place your hands lightly behind your head (or crossed over your chest, depending on preference). Keep your elbows wide to avoid pulling on your neck.
                <br> Engage the Core: Tighten your abdominal muscles and press your lower back into the floor. This will activate your core and prepare your body for the movement.
                <br> Lift Your Upper Body: Slowly curl your upper body towards your knees by lifting your shoulders and head off the ground. Keep your lower back pressed into the mat. The movement should come from your abs, not from your neck or arms.
                <br>  Top of the Movement: At the peak, your upper back should be slightly off the floor, with your shoulder blades lifted, and your chin slightly tucked in to prevent straining your neck.
                <br>  Lower Back Down: Slowly lower your upper body back to the starting position with control, making sure not to let your head or neck jerk forward.
