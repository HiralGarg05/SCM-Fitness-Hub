            <h3>Running</h3>
            <p><b> Running</b> is a fundamental and dynamic form of aerobic exercise that involves propelling the body forward by repeatedly moving one leg at a time while maintaining both feet off the ground during certain phases of the stride. It is a natural and effective way to improve cardiovascular health, build endurance, and strengthen various muscle groups.<br>
                <b>How to Perform Running</b><br>
<br>Movement:A continuous cycle of alternating steps where each foot strikes the ground momentarily before lifting off again.
Unlike walking, running involves a "flight phase," where both feet are off the ground simultaneously.
<br>Posture:Keep your body upright or slightly leaning forward.
Relax your shoulders and engage your core for stability.
<br>Arm Action:Arms should be bent at a 90-degree angle, swinging naturally in coordination with leg movements to help maintain rhythm and balance.
<br>Stride:The length and frequency of your steps vary depending on speed, terrain, and individual biomechanics.
<br>Gait:Running can differ in style (e.g., heel-to-toe, midfoot, or forefoot strike) based on the runner's preference and biomechanics.
