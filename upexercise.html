            <h3>CARDIO</h3>
            <p><b>Cardio</b> short for cardiovascular exercise, refers to any physical activity that increases your heart rate and engages large muscle groups to improve the efficiency of your heart, lungs, and circulatory system. Cardio exercises are primarily aimed at improving cardiovascular endurance and overall fitness, and they are highly effective for burning calories and improving heart health.<br>
                <b>How Often Should You Do Cardio?</b><br>
                <br>General Guidelines: The American Heart Association recommends at least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity aerobic exercise or 75 minutes of vigorous-intensity aerobic exercise per week.
                <br>For Weight Loss: If weight loss is a goal, you may want to aim for higher cardio volumes, such as 30-60 minutes most days of the week, especially when combined with a proper diet.
                <br>For General Fitness: 3-5 days a week of moderate-intensity cardio is sufficient for maintaining good cardiovascular health.

            <h3>STEP-UPS</h3>
            <p><b>Step-ups</b> are a simple yet effective lower body exercise that targets the legs, glutes, and core. Step-ups are often included in strength training routines for their ability to improve functional strength, balance, and stability. They can be done with just body weight or with added resistance, such as dumbbells or a barbell, to increase intensity. Step-ups mimic everyday movements like climbing stairs, making them excellent for improving mobility and strength for daily activities.<br>
            <b>How to Perform a Step-up</b><br>
            <br> Starting Position: Stand tall with your feet hip-width apart in front of a sturdy platform or bench. You can use a step, bench, or any raised surface that's about knee-height or slightly lower.
            <br>Step Up: Place your right foot firmly on the platform. Push through the heel of your right foot to lift your body onto the platform. Your left leg will remain on the floor, and your right leg will be fully extended at the top.
            <br> Bring the Left Leg Up (Optional): To increase the challenge, bring your left knee up toward your chest once your right leg is fully on the platform. This adds a bit of balance and core work.
            <br>Step Down: Slowly lower your body back down to the starting position by bending your right knee and stepping your left foot back onto the floor.
            <br> Repeat: Perform the desired number of reps on one leg before switching to the other leg.</p>

            <h3>CRUNCHES</h3>
            <p><b>Crunches</b> are a popular core exercise primarily aimed at strengthening the abdominal muscles. They are an excellent exercise for toning the abs and improving overall core stability. Crunches specifically target the rectus abdominis (the "six-pack" muscles) and the obliques, helping to improve posture and provide support for the spine.<br>
                <b>How to Perform a Basic Crunch</b><br>
                <br>Starting Position: Lie flat on your back on a mat with your knees bent and feet flat on the floor. Place your hands lightly behind your head (or crossed over your chest, depending on preference). Keep your elbows wide to avoid pulling on your neck.
                <br> Engage the Core: Tighten your abdominal muscles and press your lower back into the floor. This will activate your core and prepare your body for the movement.
                <br> Lift Your Upper Body: Slowly curl your upper body towards your knees by lifting your shoulders and head off the ground. Keep your lower back pressed into the mat. The movement should come from your abs, not from your neck or arms.
                <br>  Top of the Movement: At the peak, your upper back should be slightly off the floor, with your shoulder blades lifted, and your chin slightly tucked in to prevent straining your neck.
                <br>  Lower Back Down: Slowly lower your upper body back to the starting position with control, making sure not to let your head or neck jerk forward.
